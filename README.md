# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Route Finder: Navigate the Skies with Ease
This project aims to simplify the process of finding flight routes by providing an easy-to-use tool for exploring possible connections. While currently working with limited data, it showcases the potential to solve the challenge of identifying efficient travel paths and visualizing routes in a user-friendly way including layovers in the route.

## Features
- Optimal Route Calculation: Find the shortest and most efficient flight paths.
- Interactive Visualization: View flight paths on an interactive map.
- Multi-Stop Routes: Plan complex journeys with multiple layovers.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for seamless usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: React.js with Leaflet for map integration
- APIs: OpenSky Network API for real-time flight data (Reached Limit: I used very limited openFlights data)
